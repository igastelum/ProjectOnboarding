 *         1) A pronic number (or otherwise called as heteromecic) is a number
 *         which is a product of two consecutive integers, that is, a number of
 *         the form n(n + 1). Create a function that determines whether a number
 *         is pronic or not.
 * 
 *         Examples: isHeteromecic(0) ➞ true 0 (0 + 1) = 0 1 = 0
 *         isHeteromecic(2) ➞ true 1 (1 + 1) = 1 2 = 2 isHeteromecic(7) ➞ false
 *         isHeteromecic(110) ➞ true 10 (10 + 1) = 10 11 = 110
 *         isHeteromecic(136) ➞ false isHeteromecic(156) ➞ true
 * 
 * 
 *         2) Given any number, we can create a new number by adding the sums of
 *         squares of digits of that number. For example, given 203, our new
 *         number is 4 + 0 + 9 = 13. If we repeat this process, we get a
 *         sequence of numbers:
 * 
 *         203 -> 13 -> 10 -> 1 -> 1
 * 
 *         Sometimes, like with 203, the sequence reaches (and stays at) 1.
 *         Numbers like this are called happy. Not all numbers are happy. If we
 *         started with 11, the sequence would be: 11 -> 2 -> 4 -> 16 -> ...
 *         This sequence will never reach 1, and so the number 11 is called
 *         unhappy. Given a positive whole number, you have to determine whether
 *         that number is happy or unhappy.
 * 
 *         Examples: happy(203) ➞ true happy(11) ➞ false happy(107) ➞ false
 * 
 *         Notes: You can assume (and it is actually true!) that all positive
 *         whole numbers are either happy or unhappy. Any happy number will have
 *         a 1 in its sequence, and every unhappy number will have a 4 in its
 *         sequence. The only numbers passed to your function will be positive
 *         whole numbers.
